## What this repository is about<a name="about"></a>
COM, or, Channel Operating Margin, is part of the 802.3 Ethernet physical layer specification.\
It is an algorithm, or a calculation, which is used to determine whether an electrical channel (cable, trace, package) is compliant, and what is its expected performance.\
This repository is my first step in providing the (802.3) community automation tools, and later on porting COM to python.
